Just a cool addon that lets you, by hovering a link and pressing the hotkey (currently ctrl + b), to open directly your local environment!

Features that will be coming in the next version:
- better UI design
- customize hotkey
- add http parameter to the request (e.g. ?debug=true)
- export settings
- help site

Feel free to create an issue for new feature ideas or if you want, you can also create a PR with your features/optimisations!
